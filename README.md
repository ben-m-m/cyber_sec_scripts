Overview

This project simulates a Secure Vault system. It allows:

Secure storage of secrets and logs

Controlled file permissions

Safe updates to secrets

Monitoring for security risks

The project is divided into four steps, each implemented as a Bash script.

Repository Files
File	Purpose
vault_setup.sh	Initializes the vault directory and files (keys.txt, secrets.txt, logs.txt). Adds a welcome message and lists files.
vault_permissions.sh	Checks and updates file permissions interactively or applies defaults (keys.txt → 600, secrets.txt → 640, logs.txt → 644).
vault_ops.sh	Menu-driven operations: add/update secrets, append logs, and restrict access to keys.
vault_monitor.sh	Monitors vault files: displays name, size, last modified date, and permissions. Flags files with permissions >644. Generates vault_report.txt.
vault_report.txt	Generated by vault_monitor.sh. Contains a report of file metadata and security warnings.
Usage
1️⃣ Setup Vault
bash vault_setup.sh


Creates secure_vault directory and files

Adds welcome messages

Displays file list (ls -l)

2️⃣ Set File Permissions
bash vault_permissions.sh


Ensures correct file permissions

Allows interactive updates or defaults

3️⃣ Vault Operations
bash vault_ops.sh


Menu options:

Add secret

Update secret (sed -i)

Add log entry (timestamped)

Access keys → denied

Exit

4️⃣ Monitor Vault & Generate Report
bash vault_monitor.sh


Loops through files in secure_vault

Collects metadata: name, size, last modified, permissions

Flags insecure files (>644)

Saves report to vault_report.txt

Key Bash Concepts

Loops: for, while

Conditionals: if, case

File operations: touch, mkdir, ls, stat

File permissions: chmod

Redirection: >, >>

Text processing: sed, grep

Logging: date (timestamped)

Functions: reusable logic blocks

Security Notes

Keys (keys.txt) are never displayed (ACCESS DENIED 🚫)

Permissions checks in vault_monitor.sh detect files with excessive permissions

Logs are timestamped for auditing

Requirements

Linux environment with Bash shell

No additional software required

✅ Ready to run: Clone the repo and follow the usage steps in order.
